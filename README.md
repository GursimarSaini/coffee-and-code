Hello! This is the coffee and code website repo for the Phoenix area, you can see the coffee and code website at [https://coffee-and-code.surge.sh](https://coffee-and-code.surge.sh)

We are going to be using this site as a live development atmosphere for programmers to learn how to code.

Currently the website is built with [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/), which is a GoLang static website environment.  We have no problems turning this into a static website if needs be!
